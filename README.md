# Overview

I hope to one day make my own money tracking app and this is a start to how I think the logic will play out. It is a simple money tracking program made in c# with the .net framework.

I made a money tracking program using the main program class, a custom Category class and Transaction class.

I wrote this simple software as a starting point for an app I hope to one day create for tracking money in the way that want to track it without having to pay a monthly subscription fee to another service.
